It's probably one of the most anticipated Windows Mobile devices to ever be released. Does it live up to the hype? In short — yes! Talk about a tech lover's dream, this thing has everything. From a quad-band EDGE/tri-band UMTS/HSDPA radio, to integrated GPS, 3 megapixel camera with auto-focus, 400MHz processor, full QWERTY keyboard, tilting slide out screen, Bluetooth, WiFi; the list goes on and on.</p>
<p>Best of all, the HSDPA 3.6Mbps connection will make me switch out my home DSL line...</p>
