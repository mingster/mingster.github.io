<p>Living and working in bay area for so long and I'm always being a homeboy + geek engineer just like others until I've this Taiwanese musician girl friend as company. She's sure a party girl and bring a lot of different looks in my life.</p>
<p>Recently she requested me to go to this live Jazz pub in the city. She and her musician buddies are hanging out there every Monday night. It's pretty cool - the small circle of friends and friends of friends would take terms to go on to the stage, singing or Improvised with their own instrument, each for about 5 to 10 minutes.</p>
<p>It's so damn cool just like the karaoke back home. If you like to get to know the local Jazz community in the city, Monday night at Rasselas is the place to check out.</p>
