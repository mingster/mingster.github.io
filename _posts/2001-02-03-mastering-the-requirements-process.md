<div class="content"><strong>Amazon.com</strong><br />Written in an engaging style and relevant for any software analyst or designer, <i>Mastering the Requirements Process</i> provides a powerful and useful guide to defining more complete software requirements that lead to better software overall. It's also filled with innovative advice.
<p>The heart of this book is the authors' Volere Requirements Process Model, a step-by-step guide to gathering your requisites. Throughout this book, the authors use this process to explicate a single case study--a system for a municipality that will optimize the de-icing of roadways during snowy weather. Along the way, the book provides a solid guide to identifying and refining requirements, both functional and nonfunctional (such as performance and ease of use).</p>
<p>There are many excellent ideas in the book, including the notion of fitness for your requirements, which can be later used to track whether the software is successful. The book also wisely separates technology from requirements so that analysts can concentrate on understanding and modeling business problems instead of moving right away to the nuts and bolts of implementation. Even if you don't adopt the Volere model in toto, you can benefit from the concepts of "trawling" (a metaphor for the requirements-gathering process), quality gateways (in which tentative requirements are evaluated for inclusion in a project), and the wise use of patterns to help simplify the process.</p>
<p>Anchored by numerous examples (including many samples of successful requirements), the book provides an appealing mix of new ideas along with a remarkably clear presentation. In short, <i>Mastering the Requirements Process</i> provides useful advice that can make the project specification building phase of the software process easier and more robust. It provides the first steps for improving overall software quality for your organization. <i>--Richard Dragan</i></p>
<p><b>Topics covered</b>: Volere Requirements Process Model; project blastoff; determining requirements; user and stakeholders; project constraints; requirements constraints; use cases; business events; adjacent systems; innovation; trawling for requirements: apprenticing, interviews, and videotape; functional and nonfunctional requirements; fit criteria; quality gateways; traceability; prototyping and scenarios; low and high fidelity prototypes; patterns and requirements reuse; improving the requirements gathering process.</p>
<p><b>Product Description:</b><br />Written by two internationally acclaimed experts on requirements, Mastering the Requirements Process provides software engineers with the practical insights, techniques and templates to discover exactly what their customers desire for their systems. It also explains how to implement an easily learned, ongoing forma requirements process which allows the requirements to evolve over the life time of the project. Using this book you will learn how to ask the right questions, how to determine whether or not the final solution will satisfy the requirements, how to fit the solution to the requirements to provide high quality products and even how to reuse requirements. The result is, systems that the user loves to use! </p>
