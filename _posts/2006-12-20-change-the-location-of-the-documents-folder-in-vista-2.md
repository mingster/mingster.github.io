<p>The all familiar My Documents folder in Windows XP has been renamed the Documents folder in Vista. Vista creates Documents folder for each user that logs onto the computer and stores it in the appropriate profile folder. The default location for this folder is c:\Users\\Documents (assuming of course that you have installed Vista on your C: drive). You can store the Documents folder on another drive or in another folder. For example, if you have more free space on another drive, you can move it.</p>
<p>To accomplish this task, right click Documents from the Start Menu and select Properties. This opens the Properties dialog box for the Documents folder. Click the Location tab and type in the path to the location where you want to store the folder. Click OK. If the folder location you specified in the Target field does not exist, the Create Message dialog box will appear. Click Yes to create the folder and click OK. Alternatively, you can also select the Move button from the Location tab and browse to the location where you want to store the Documents folder.</p>
