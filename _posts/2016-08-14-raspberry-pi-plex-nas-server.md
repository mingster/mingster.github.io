<p>update: So far the Raspberry Pi 3 is not powerful enough for me.  It takes several minutes for a movie to start streaming a mp4 file to ATV in the same LAN.  It just not good enough, yet.</p>
<p>My mac is getting old, can't work on it as CPU go up to 100% while family is watching.</p>
<p>The plan is to move the Plex server to Raspberry Pi.  It should be a economical replacement for the media function. </p>
<p>The solution seems mature, references can be found easily. I ordered <a href="http://makezine.com/2016/02/28/meet-the-new-raspberry-pi-3/">the new board</a>, prepare the SD card, and format my 4TB external USB drive to ext4 format.  As the board arrives, I will get my hand dirty and note the process here. </p>
