<p>A Charlotte NC lawyer purchased a box of very rare and expensive cigars then insured them against fire among other things. Within a month having smoked his entire stockpile of these great cigars and without yet having made even his first premium payment on the policy, the lawyer filed a claim against the insurance company. In his claim, the lawyer stated the cigars were lost "in a series of small fires."</p>
<p>The insurance company refused to pay, citing the obvious reason, that the man had consumed the cigars in the normal fashion. The lawyer sued and won! In delivering the ruling the judge agreed with the insurance company that the claim was frivolous, however; the judge stated that the lawyer held a policy from the company in which it had warranted that the cigars were insurable and also guaranteed that it would insure them against fire, without defining what is considered to be "unacceptable fire," and was obligated to pay the claim. Rather than endure a lengthy and costly appeal process, the insurance company accepted the ruling and paid $15,000 to the lawyer for his loss of the rare cigars lost in the "fires."</p>
<p>NOW FOR THE BEST PART. After the lawyer cashed the check, the insurance company had him arrested on 24 counts of ARSON!!!! With his own insurance claim and testimony from the previous case being used against him, the lawyer was convicted of intentionally burning his insured property and sentenced him to 24 months in jail and a $24,000 fine. This is a true story and was the 1st place winner in the recent Criminal Lawyers Award Contest.</p>
<p>有名北卡 Charlotte的律師買了一盒極為稀有且昂貴的雪茄，還為雪茄投保了火險。結果他在一個月內把這些頂級雪茄抽完了，保險費一毛也還沒繳，卻提出要保險公司賠償的要求。在申訴中，律師說雪茄在「一連串的小火」中受損。保險公司當然不願意賠償，理由是：此人是以正常方式抽完雪茄。...... 結果律師告上法院還贏了這場官司。</p>
<p>法官在判決時表示，他同意保險公司的說法，認為此項申訴非常荒謬，但是該律師手上的確有保險公司同意承保的保單，證明保險公司保證賠償任何火險，且保單中沒有明確指出何類「火」不在保險範圍內。因此，保險公司必須賠償。與其忍受漫長昂貴的上訴過程，保險公司決定接受這項判決，並且賠償美金一萬五千元的雪茄「火險」。</p>
<p>以下才是最精彩的地方： 律師將支票兌現之後，保險公司馬上報警將他逮捕，罪名是涉嫌 24 起「縱火案」！！！ 由他自己先前的申訴和證詞，這名律師立即以「蓄意燒毀已投保之財產」的罪名被定罪，要入獄服刑二十四個月，並罰款美金二萬四千元。</p>
<p>這種事，也只是有在美國才會發生！</p>
