<p>Every once awhile, as I read or watch, there's associated music pop up in my head. Often time I don't remember the name of the music, just piece of lyrc or rhythm. Thanks to Google and the Net, this time I'm able to locate it within 2 quick searches.</p>
<p>The music is a HK TV song and it's more then 10 years old. If you're in my age and know the song, I'm sure it bring back a lot of memory. There're a lot of stories to say about it, but anyway, I found the song in 30 seconds in this cool site from China.</p>
<p>Why this site is cool? live lyrc, good db (from very old to new, and expanding), and it's FREE!<br /><a href="http://www.1ting.com/player/7f/player_61782.html"><img id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5118491352872830066" alt="" src="/img/image001.jpg" border="0" /></a>Check it out for yourself.</p>
