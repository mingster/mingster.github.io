All the sudden everyone has to talk about community building and develop those dynamic scripting effort.
<p>In fact, back at 10 years ago (1997) Desktop.com had the vision and actually build up a business for what Google app is trying to do today. Back at the time some people from the North think it's crazy and useless for fat desktop-like applications to run on the web.</p>
<p>Well, those people might be 50% correct, desktop.com is no longer in business and you can only see it at web archive (<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20000301124055/www.desktop.com/site/platform.html" target="_blank">the original desktop.com Web OS</a>); however the same old techiques (now can be called AJAX), isn't a joke anymore. </p>
<p>As I bring back my old little <a href="http://mingster.com/kernel/" target="blank"><b>Mac Kernel</b></a> back to life, it is still works like a champ in FireFox and IE 7. Allow popup window for the moment and click the image above to bring some of your good old memory back... </p>
<p>I did it for fun and learning back at 199x. It's advanced JavaScript then and now. It were a mod from someone from German (sorry, no longer has your name to credit you). And Yes, the work is almost 10 years old and is still way cool.</p>
<p>Here's another old school and yet still in good hand piece: "<a href="http://blog.tool-man.org/toolman-dhtml-02-released/16" target="blank">ToolMan DHTML Library</a>". The small yet snippy JavaScript allow you to create Drag &amp; Drop, Sorting, Edit in Place. Best of all, it's old :)</p>
<p>Thanks Tim for showing off the work.</p>
