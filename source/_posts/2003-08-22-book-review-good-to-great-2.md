<p><strong><span style="font-size:100%;">Good to Great: Why Some Companies Make the Leap... and Others Don't<br /></span></strong>by <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/search-handle-url/index=books&amp;field-author-exact=Jim%20Collins&amp;rank=-relevance%2C%2Bavailability%2C-daterank/103-2319014-6360612">Jim Collins</a><a href="http://rcm.amazon.com/e/cm?t=mingster-20&#038;o=1&#038;p=8&#038;l=as1&#038;asins=0066620996&#038;fc1=FFFFCC&#038;IS2=1&#038;lt1=_blank&#038;lc1=FFCC00&#038;bc1=000000&#038;bg1=000000&#038;f=ifr">http://rcm.amazon.com/e/cm?t=mingster-20&#038;o=1&#038;p=8&#038;l=as1&#038;asins=0066620996&#038;fc1=FFFFCC&#038;IS2=1&#038;lt1=_blank&#038;lc1=FFCC00&#038;bc1=000000&#038;bg1=000000&#038;f=ifr</a></p>
<p>Good to Great is a great business management book.  The book is actual a 2nd part of Professor Collin's research report.  In his early research's observation (also booked as "Build to Last"), the "Built to Last" companies he choose had always been great (for reasons, of course).  In this book, he further analyze for those good companies (but not yet great) what's missing.</p>
<p>The Good-to-Great concepts are:</p>
<p>
<ol>
<li><strong>5 Level Leadership</strong>: where leaders channel their ego needs away from themselves and into the larger goal of building a great company. Note: If Donald Trump is your role model I do not recommend this book for you. </li>
<p>
<li><strong>First Who ... Then What</strong>: first get the right people on the bus, wrong people off the bus, right people in the right seats and then figure out where to drive. This is similar to Buckingham's "Select for Talent" and "Find the Right Fit" in his book First Break All The Rules. </li>
<p>
<li><strong>Confront the Brutal Facts (Yet Never Lose Faith)</strong>: have faith that you can and will prevail in the end, and at the same time have the discipline to confront the most brutal facts of your current reality. </li>
<p>
<li><strong>The Hedgehog Concept</strong>: simplicity within the three circles of What you are deeply passionate about, What drives your economic engine and What you can be the best in the world at. </li>
<p>
<li><strong>A Culture of Discipline</strong>: when you have disciplined people, thought and action, you don't need hierarchy, bureaucracy and excessive controls. </li>
<p>
<li><strong>Technology Accelerators</strong>: technology should be used as an accelerator of momentum, not as a creator of it. </li>
<p>
<li><strong>The Flywheel and the Doom Loop</strong>: building momentum over a span of time leads to breakthroughs while shortcuts seldom do.</li>
</ol>
<p>
<p>I highly recommended this one... </p>
