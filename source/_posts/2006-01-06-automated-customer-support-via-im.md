<p>Here's the conversation between me and the bot:</p>
<p><span style="color:#c0c0c0;">mingster says:</span><br />what's your name?<br /><span style="color:#ffa500;"><br />Encarta速 Instant Answers says:<br /></span>Welcome, mingster! My name is Encarta Instant Answers. I am a smart computer who can bring you the Encarta info you want right in your IM window!<br />Here are some questions you can ask me:<br />* What is the capital of Canada?<br />* Where was Abraham Lincoln born?<br />* How many calories are there in an orange?</p>
<p>
<p>Type your question and I'll look it up for you!</p>
<p><span style="color:#000080;"><span style="color:#c0c0c0;">mingster says:</span><br /></span>how many people live in bay area?</p>
<p><span style="color:#ffa500;">Encarta速 Instant Answers says:<br /></span>I'm not sure I understood you correctly.  Let's try an Encarta search. =&gt;</p>
<p>  Encarta速 Instant Answers is inviting you to start Encarta. Do you want to Accept (Alt+C) or Decline (Alt+D) the invitation?</p>
<p>  You have accepted the invitation to start Encarta.</p>
<p><span style="color:#ffa500;">Encarta速 Instant Answers says:<br /></span>Thanks for accepting my invitation! The application should load shortly. =&gt;</p>
<p>To see it for yourself, add <a title="mailto:encarta@conversagent.com" href="mailto:encarta@conversagent.com">encarta@conversagent.com</a> to your msn contact.</p>
<p>If you're interested in developing bots, there's at least two places to start on the Web:</p>
<p><a title="http://www.wiredbots.com" href="http://www.wiredbots.com/" target="_blank">Wired bots</a> - McClelland's site on bots. His site has updates on bot building, a "how-to" section on constructing smart bots and a BotBase collection of modifictions, addons, commands, and full bots that have been submitted by users. The bot list can be found here as well.</p>
<p><a title="http://www.interconnected.org/googlematic" href="http://www.interconnected.org/googlematic" target="_blank">Interconnected</a> - Matt Webb's site on his Googlematic bot has links to sites that can help in building a bot.</p>
